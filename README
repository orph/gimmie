I spend a lot of my time doing the same things over and over with my
computer, so I wrote an application to try to give me some control over
that routine.  Maybe you spend time doing the same sorts of things.

Maybe Gimmie can help you take control too.

Gimmie tries to provide a handle on the people you interact with, the
documents you create, and the applications you use to create them.
